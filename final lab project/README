Description of what I did and the task at hand:
In this program I had to basically allow the switches to have their hosts 
talk to eachother based on their IP addresses. Hosts of the same subnet should
be able to send packets to one another and hosts of each switch should be able
to communicate with eachother. I implemented this by adding several if 
statements to a certain section of the code. In each of the switches, I first
checked if the src_ip in the Network is True and the dst_ip in the Network are
true, then return true. If this statement comes out to be true, then it is
basically checking if the both hosts that want to communicate on different 
switches are part of the same subnet. After this if statement, I then had to
implement code to check of hosts within the same switch are able to 
communicate with eachother or not. I did this by manually checking the src_ip
and dst_ip of all the possibilities of this. If the src_ip was equal to some
ip number and the dst_ip was equal to another number, then the code would return
True. I made all these changes in the section of the code that says "FIX ME".

How to run this program:
Open up two XTERMS on Mininet and then in one terminal type in "~/pox/pox.py misc.router". In the other terminal type in "sudo python final_topo.py". Then type in pingall and see the movement of packets from one host to another.
