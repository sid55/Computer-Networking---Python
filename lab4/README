Description:
In this program, we had to implement a firewall that basically does not allow
packets with no port numbers be sent to their destination hosts. In order
to implement this, I first had to logically understand what to change and the 
process the packet undergoes when sent from one host to another. Thus, here is
the process. The first packet is sent from the host to the switch and the
switch sends that packet to the controller. The controller then analyzes
that packet and depending on whether or not there is a port number, it will
either set the action in of_flow_mod to either send the next upcoming packets 
to the destination host from the switch without consulting the controller or notsend it. Of_flow_mod is part of the switch is what the switch first consults 
before talking to the controller. This Of_flow_mod has timeouts that basically
allow all packets with that same infomation that traveled to the controller
be allowed to be sent to the destination host directly from the switch. Using
this logic I realized that whenever a packet is handled inside the controller,
the firewall method needs to be called and inside that method, I could
implement this of_flow_mod logic. Inside this method I would either accept
or drop packets depending on the information they contain as I have explained
above. This is my thought process and the description of this program. The 
pox controller acts as a firewall analyzing whether or not certain packets can
be sent to the destination host.
